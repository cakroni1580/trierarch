> [!WARNING]
> # Warning: KWin Instability on Trierarch
>
>Due to recent KDE updates, Trierarch encounters KWin crashes. Developers are actively working to resolve these compatibility issues. If the situation remains unfixable, a transition to the Debian distribution is planned, as testing confirms that Debian’s stable KDE version remains functional on Trierarch.

> [!NOTE]
> Good news, everyone! I’ve successfully fixed the crash issue. Right now, I'm in the middle of reworking trierarch to add several highly requested features from the community. Thanks for bearing with me—I really want to bring you a much better version of trierarch!
# Trierarch

[中文](README.zh.md) | English

**Download:** latest APK → **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Beauty114514/trierarch/releases/latest)**.

## Demo

| KDE Plasma (Wayland) | VS Code (inside proot) |
|------------------------|-------------------------|

---

**Trierarch** is an Android app that runs an **Arch Linux** rootfs using a **proot**-style container, with a custom **Wayland** compositor (development and tuning focus on **KDE Plasma (Wayland)**). The goal is your own **Arch** + **KDE Plasma 6 (Wayland)** mobile desktop.

## 1. First launch: automatic rootfs download

- If there is no usable rootfs under `data_dir/arch` at first launch, the app **downloads and extracts** the Arch Linux aarch64 rootfs from [proot-distro](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro/releases) (~156 MB). Network required.

## 2. Before the desktop: enter Terminal (shortcut) and install Plasma inside proot

Long-press the app icon to show **shortcuts**, then tap **Terminal** to enter the **Arch shell inside proot**.

![App shortcut](docs/images/shortcut.jpg)

In the proot Arch shell, **update first, then install the desktop** (example; adjust packages as you like):

```bash
pacman -Syu
pacman -S plasma-meta dolphin konsole
```

## 3. Floating menu orb and Display (open menu, set Display script, start the desktop)

- **Floating menu orb** — A draggable **orb** on screen; **short tap** opens a **glass menu** (**Display**, **View Settings**, **Appearance**, **Keyboard**, and related actions). Drag the orb to move it; position is remembered between sessions.

![Floating menu orb](docs/images/floatingOrb.jpg)

| Menu open (terminal / Wayland view) | Menu open (desktop session) |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| ![Orb menu in terminal view](docs/images/floutMenuInTerminal.jpg) | ![Orb menu on desktop](docs/images/floutMenuInDesktop.jpg) |

- **Display** — **Long-press** to edit the **Display startup script**; **short-press** to run it and start Plasma. **If a Wayland client is already connected, the app does not run the script again.**

**Recommended script** (session D-Bus via `dbus-launch`, then Plasma Wayland; redirect output so the script doesn’t block):

```bash
dbus-launch --exit-with-session startplasma-wayland > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

**Audio note (PulseAudio):** Trierarch runs a host PulseAudio daemon (AAudio sink) and exposes it to the proot desktop over a Unix socket. To avoid "silent but playing" cases caused by the default **Null Output**, Trierarch will **auto-inject** a small snippet into your saved Display startup script that waits for PulseAudio and runs `pactl set-default-sink trierarch-out` (idempotent; it won’t be inserted twice).

Even in a **proot** environment, it is good practice to **run the desktop as a normal user**, not as root. If you want to dig deeper, read ArchWiki **[Users and groups](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Users_and_groups)** and **[Sudo](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sudo)**; otherwise the short recipe below is enough.

**Create a user and sudo (example user `myuser`):**

```bash
pacman -S sudo
useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash myuser
passwd myuser
EDITOR=nano visudo
```

In the editor, you can either **uncomment** the line `%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL` so everyone in group `wheel` may use `sudo`, **or** leave that line as-is and **add below it** a dedicated rule, e.g. `myuser ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`. Alternatively, add a file under `/etc/sudoers.d/` (same syntax; use `visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/myuser` to avoid syntax errors). Save and exit.

In the **Display** script editor (long-press **Display**), start Plasma **as that user** so files under `/home/myuser` belong to the session: **first line** switch to the account, **Enter**, **second line** the startup command. See the screenshot below.

![Display in orb menu](docs/images/displayScript.jpg)

**Sessions** (orb menu) lists terminal tabs—switch, add, or remove sessions.

![Sessions](docs/images/sessionSettings.jpg)

**Appearance** (orb menu): customize the in-app **Terminal** look—**fonts only** for now. For further beautification or theming ideas, **open an issue**—reasonable suggestions welcome.

## 4. Daily use: tap app to auto-start the desktop

After you have set a Display startup script, you can **tap the app icon normally** to enter the desktop view; the app will **inject and run the Display script automatically** (idempotent when a desktop client is already connected).

The **Terminal** shortcut is for **first-time setup** (e.g. installing the desktop and terminal packages) or when you **prefer the in-app native terminal**—it’s optimized for **smooth switching** between the **desktop and terminal** views.

## 5. After Plasma starts: View Settings and terminal ↔ desktop switching

### Hardware acceleration

Trierarch currently supports **cross-chip** hardware acceleration (see renderer mode **UNIVERSAL**). More **high-performance** device-specific paths are still **in development**.

### View Settings

Open **View Settings** from the orb menu to tune the compositor and pointer behavior:

![View Settings](docs/images/viewSettings.jpg)

- **Pointer / mouse mode** — e.g. **touchpad-style (relative)** vs **tablet-style (absolute)**.
- **UI size vs clarity** — **Resolution** and **Scale** can be **combined**: Resolution lowers output resolution to reduce compositing load **and** adjusts on-screen element size; Scale resizes via scaling without changing the backing resolution to keep text/UI sharp. There’s no single “correct” mix—tune until it fits **your** device and habits.

### Switching between terminal and desktop with Display

After Plasma is running, tap **Display** in the orb menu again to return to the **terminal / Wayland** view; **open the orb menu → Display** to go back to the desktop. The orb menu and Display work in both the shell view and on the desktop.

## 6. In-rootfs tuning (`trierarch-optimize`)

For topic guides (browser, IME, fonts, etc.) after you’re on the desktop, see **[`trierarch-optimize/README.md`](trierarch-optimize/README.md)** ([中文](trierarch-optimize/README.zh.md)).

**Strongly recommended:** fix **Baloo / virtual `tags:/`** issues common under **proot** (otherwise repeated pop-ups and wasted resources). Follow **[Baloo and `tags:/`](trierarch-optimize/baloo-tags-warning.md)** ([中文](trierarch-optimize/baloo-tags-warning.zh.md)).

For general Arch setup and troubleshooting, use **[ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)** and the **[Arch Linux Chinese Wiki](https://wiki.archlinuxcn.org/)**. This app is **proot + Wayland**; some full-desktop assumptions (kernel, systemd sessions, …) may not apply.

## 7. Keyboard and input (orb menu Keyboard, GTK / Qt)

The **Keyboard** item in the orb menu can **invoke** the soft keyboard.

![Keyboard in orb menu](docs/images/keyboard.jpg)

In **GTK** apps you can enter **non-ASCII** characters (Chinese, emoji, special characters, etc.); input is completed automatically via the **`Ctrl+Shift+U`** path.

**Qt** apps often don’t support that path: type in a **GTK** app first (**Mousepad**), then **copy/paste** into Qt. The **Android soft keyboard** and **Plasma clipboard** are **not integrated**—copy/paste inside Linux using the mouse or shortcuts (e.g. `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V`). You can use a full soft keyboard such as [**Unexpected Keyboard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=juloo.keyboard2) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Julow/Unexpected-Keyboard)).
